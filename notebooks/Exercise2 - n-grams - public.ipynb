    "Each week you will receive a handout with some theoretical and/ or programming tasks related to NLP. You can also work on them at home, but be aware that in the practice class you have the opportunity to discuss and ask questions. <br>\n",

Working on these homework tasks and handing them in is not mandatory, but you can benefit from that in two ways: You get feedback on your solutions and a better understanding of the subject, and, more importantly, you have the chance to improve your final grade for the exam. If you hand in your solutions, we will grade them based on their quality. For each homework task there are points to collect depending on the amount\n",
